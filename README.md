This repository is for my personal website. It's utilizing svelte and vite for SSG. I'm hosting on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview). This is a custom implementation, but you can follow their [quickstart guide for vanilla-js](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to get started. Hosting is very affordable (free for low traffic).
